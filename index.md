About Me
========

### Web Development

I have been working on some small programming projects since 2014.

I started creating blogs with wordpress and blogger, \
 and after couple months, I was learning how to code HTML5 and CSS3 from
scratch.

I have successfuly finished some tutorial projects from UDEMY, \
 about JAVA and PHP, which I applied to different projects

I possess a Google Digital Garage Certificate for: Digital Marketing

I am now more focused on backend development with Python

I also have a Certificate of Web Design from GetSmarter after a 100
hours course

### Programming Languages

I have learnt and have a good understanding of:

-   HTML5 {.display-2}
    =====

-   CSS3 {.display-2}
    ====

-   JavaScript {.display-2}
    ==========

I have now fully changed my focus to:

-   Python {.display-2}
    ======

I have already done some projects of artificial intelligence \
 and I am working on some web projects with Flask and Django \
 My goal is to be more focused on the backend, and also in the future
create some GUI using Python.
